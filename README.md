**Use Golang to create simple, maintainable systems to solve complex business problems**

## What is this book about?
This book will help Go engineers build high-quality, structured code that fully represents the domain in which they are working. This book also shows you how principles of Domain-driven design can be applied to Go specifically.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Get to grips with domains and the evolution of Domain-driven design
* Work with stakeholders to manage complex business needs
* Gain a clear understanding of bounded context, services, and value objects
* Get up and running with aggregates, factories, repositories, and services
* Find out how to apply DDD to monolithic applications and microservices
* Discover how to implement DDD patterns on distributed systems
* Understand how Test-driven development and Behavior-driven development can work with DDD

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
=== RUN Test_Point
value_objects_test.go:13: a and b were not equal
--- FAIL: Test_Point (0.00s)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for intermediate-level Go developers who are looking to ensure that they not only write maintainable code, but also deliver great business value. If you have a basic understanding of Go and are interested in learning about Domain-driven design, or you’ve explored Domain-driven design before but never in the context of Go, then this book will be helpful.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-8).
